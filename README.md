# snsrv [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/snsrv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/snsrv)

A [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/) compatible api and self hosted notes server.

## WARNING

This is currently under heavy development and not all features are implemented yet, and implemented features could change at any moment.


## Features

- aims to be 100% compatible with the simplenote third party api (this means you should be able to point your simplenote client to the address of this server and it will work out of the box)
- multiuser, secure, etc...
- selfhosted!!
- scalable with flask structure and options for implemented database backend with scalable databases (currently only sqlite3 backend implemented)
- web admin interface (TODO - currently very limited)

## Dependencies

The following software and libraries are used:

- python3

Python libraries:

- flask
- flask-cors
- bcrypt
- sqlite

These can be installed with your package manager, or with pip once python is installed.


## Running

For running/testing with the flask dev server, you can simply do the following:

1. clone the repo

2. edit config.py to suit

3. install deps and run!

```
pyvenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## TODO/ROADMAP

- [ALMOST] complete and stabilize a database backend
           (almost complete using sqlite3 - probably not very well optimised though)
- [ALMOST] sanitize data on update and create, etc.
- [ALMOST - just tags api to go] implement complete api (aiming for simplenote api v2.1.3)
- [TODO] implement note sharing
- [TODO] more testing of api! (now fairly stable based on testing with [sncli](https://github.com/swalladge/sncli))
- [TODO] document the api
- [TODO] web interface for managing users
- [TODO] full web interface for interacting with notes


## Contributing

At the moment the server needs a lot of work!
Many things must be implemented, and then thoroughly tested for compatibility, stability, and security.
If you would like to contribute, feel free to contact me, raise an issue, or submit a pull request. :)

## Documentation

The api is documented using [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com/). Docs can be generated by the following:

```
npm install apidoc -g
cd /path/to/snsrv
apidoc
# open /path/to/snsrv/doc/index.html
```

Docs for the server are sparse at the moment.
See `config.py` for example configuration options.
