# snsrv [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/snsrv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swalladge/snsrv)

A [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/) compatible api and self hosted notes server.

## WARNING

This is currently under heavy development and not all features are implemented yet, and implemented features could change at any moment.


## Features

- aims to be 100% compatible with the simplenote third party api (this means you should be able to point your simplenote client to the address of this server and it will work out of the box)
- multiuser, secure, etc...
- selfhosted!!
- scalable with tornado and sqlalchemy
- web admin interface (TODO - currently very limited)

## Dependencies

The following software and libraries are used:

- python3

Python libraries:

- tornado
- sqlalchemy
- bcrypt

These can be installed with your package manager, or with pip once python is installed.


## Running

For running/testing, you can simply do the following:

1. clone the repo
2. edit config.py to suit
3. install deps and run (preferably in a virtual env)!

```
git clone https://github.com/swalladge/snsrv.git
cd snsrv
vim config.py
pyvenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## TODO/ROADMAP

- refactor to use tornado and sqlalchemy, instead of flask and homebuilt orm
- finish implementing entire api (based on Simplenote APi v2.1.3)
- test for stability and security
- admin interface/api (for managing users, etc.)
- add extra features like note sharing/public


## Contributing

At the moment the server needs a lot of work!
Many things must be implemented, and then thoroughly tested for compatibility, stability, and security.
If you would like to contribute, feel free to contact me, raise an issue, or submit a pull request. :)

## Documentation

The api is documented using [raml](http://raml.org/). Docs can be generated by the following:
See `config.py` for example configuration options.
